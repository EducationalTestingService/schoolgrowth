SCHOOLGROWTH

This R package provides functions for improving the accuracy of school-level aggregate growth measures using Empirical Best Linear Prediction (EBLP).
It uses student-level growth scores for particular years, grades, and subjects to compute simple average estimates and EBLPs of specified school-level aggregate growth targets. 
Estimated MSEs for both direct estimates and EBLPs are also provided.
The details of the functions are described in Lockwood et al. (2022).
